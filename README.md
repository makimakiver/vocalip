# 🎯 What We're Building

We are developing a revolutionary platform that enables voice actors to register and monetize their voices as intellectual property (IP) assets on the Story Protocol. In short this system will look like a voice selling platform where video creators can choose which cloned voice to use in there videos. 

Key Features:
• Fully decentralised voice Registration System for IP Assets
• Smart Contract Integration with Story Protocol
• AI Voice Cloning Implementation

## **🔍 Problems**

Recent technology enables us to bring anime characters to life, and these characters can now even talk with you on a call. However, the IP rights of voice actors are being violated, since anyone can easily clone the voice of a random cartoon character and use it to create content on major social media platforms (e.g., YouTube, Instagram). None of the profits generated by this AI‐generated content are attributed back to the original voice actor, which is extremely problematic. In addition, the business model of AI content-creation tools is imperfect: users must pay a subscription fee up front and only generate revenue afterward.

AI-driven voice remixing is an amazing technology, but there are still many areas in need of improvement.

> Summary: Voice actors currently receive no share of the profits when creators use AI-cloned versions of their voices to generate monetised content on platforms like YouTube or Instagram.

## **💡 Solution**

As far as I know, there isn’t currently a system that lets users register their voice as an IP asset on story protocol. I’d like to use this buildathon as an opportunity to create an application where dozens of voice actors can register their voices as IP assets on Story. In this model, any AI-generated voice-over content is treated as a derivative work of the original voice. When creators use these cloned voices to generate revenue, a share of the profits will be attributed back to the original voice actor via the PIL terms in the Story SDK. At this stage, I recognize there are lacks in my project plan, so I’ll be refining these ideas later.

> *Summary: I will solve the issue by enabling voice actors to register their voice as an IP asset on story protocol. Our service is the extension of the concept…*

## **💻 How to run?**

Fist you will need to create `.env` file and configure the following in the file
```
PINATA_JWT=
GATEWAY_URL=
PINATA_GATEWAY_TOKEN=
PINATA_API_KEY=
PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY=
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=
STORY_NETWORK=aeneid
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=
```

Then you will run followings in terminal ( we used bun as Pinata only allows bun)
```bash
bun install 
bun run dev
```
